## Course Breakdown
The certificate covers advanced data analytics, machine learning, and decision-making techniques:

1. **Foundations of Data Science** â€“ This course introduces the role of data professionals, key analytical concepts, and the PACE (Plan, Analyze, Construct, Execute) framework for managing data projects. Youâ€™ll explore essential data tools, effective communication skills, and career opportunities in data analytics and data science.
2. **Get Started with Python** â€“ This course covers the basics of Python programming for data analysis. You will learn about variables, data types, loops, functions, and data structures, and how to use Python libraries like NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation.
3. **Go Beyond the Numbers** â€“ This course focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and effective data storytelling. Youâ€™ll learn to clean, structure, and visualize data, making it accessible for business decision-making.
4. **The Power of Statistics** â€“ This course covers descriptive and inferential statistics, probability, and hypothesis testing. Youâ€™ll apply statistical methods to analyze datasets and communicate findings effectively.
5. **Regression Analysis** â€“ This course introduces predictive modeling, focusing on regression techniques like linear regression, ANOVA, and logistic regression. Youâ€™ll learn to build and interpret models for business analysis.
6. **The Nuts and Bolts of Machine Learning** â€“ This course covers supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques. Youâ€™ll learn about models such as Naive Bayes, decision trees, random forests, and K-means clustering to solve business problems.
7. **Capstone Project** â€“ In this final capstone project, youâ€™ll apply your skills to a real-world business problem, integrating data visualization, statistics, regression models, and machine learning techniques.
